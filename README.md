### Overview
Contents of this repository are organized according to code, data, results, and plots. All plots and results shown in the main text and supplementary material are generated in script_main.R and script_supplement.R respectively, with the exception of the sensitivity analyses. Folders for code, data, results, and plots related to the sensitivity analysis described in the supplemental text are located in a sensitivity subfolder within each of those folders.

All code for the analysis featured in the main document was written in the R language (version 3.5.2) and was executed on a Lenovo Thinkpad running Linux (PureOS 9.0). The sensitivity analyses were written in R (version 3.6.2) and run on a Linux cluster. At the time the research was done, all R packages used in this analysis were available on CRAN and were straightforward to install and load.
