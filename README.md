# sarscov2_unobserved
Estimating unobserved SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States

The purpose of this repository is to make code and data available that were used in the analysis described in the following pdf.

The authors of this work are exhausted after working very hard to finish this analysis and write the manuscript. After we take a quick break to get some rest, we will clean up the code underlying the results in our manuscript and update this repository.

In the meantime, you can find a precursor of our model in the following repository. The basics of how the model works are captured by this repository, although a number of important updates occurred between posting this initial code on March 12 and the preprint on March 15.

Stay tuned...
